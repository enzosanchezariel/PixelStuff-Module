# What this module does
Adds Pixel UI Sounds and system apps to make Pixel Launcher work properly.
A weird combo you would only need if you are using a bare bone AOSP ROM/GSI and hate the default AOSP launcher.
# Disclaimer
- I have no idea what I'm doing. Just placing files that I guess are important and I do not have. It works for me though ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
- This module just places files systemlessly in fixed directories and assumes you do not have any of the apps added by the module already installed in your system.
- It is only compatible with Android 13.
- Is only tested in AOSP (Ponces Android 13 AOSP with GAPPS baked in).
# Special thanks
- Shiypc for the base module (pixelifier) where I extracted the saunds and basic scripts. If you only want the sounds, go check their repo instead, it also has notification sounds, ringtones, etc.
- ChonDoit for some overlay files I extracted from their Pixel Experience Plus GSI.
- BasGame1 (Pixelify-Next author) for the help.
