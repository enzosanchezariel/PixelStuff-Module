# Pixelifier

Pixelifier is a Magisk module to make your Android 12+ device a bit more like a Pixel.

It's designed for stock AOSP ROMs (like the official GSI) and gives a Pixel touch to your phone.

## Features

- Google Sans and Google Sans Text fonts, properly implemented
- Google Sans Clock font for the lock screen
- Round icons system-wide
- Lowercase system buttons in notifications, etc. like Pixel
- Pixel sound scheme

## Disclaimer

Android 12 and above is required. Tested on stock Google-built GSI but should work anywhere Android isn't heavily modified.

Pixelifier is not designed for non-stock ROMs. It won't work on HyperOS/MIUI, One UI/TouchWiz, ColorOS/OxygenOS, Moto Hello UI, or whatever Huawei uses. If you have one of these devices, perhaps look into trying a GSI with dynamic system update. Pixelifier will work there.

I claim no responsibility for bricks, but I doubt this will brick your phone. If it does, that's probably on you :trollface:
