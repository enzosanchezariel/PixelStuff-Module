# Pixelifier

Pixelifier V2 is here! The Google Sans installation method has been refactored to work WITHOUT changing Roboto, and also includes variable font versions (so font weights work nicely!)

Will only work on Android 12 (S) and later. Tested on Vanilla Ice Cream (15) Public Release, and probably works on Baklava and Upside Down Cake (14).
